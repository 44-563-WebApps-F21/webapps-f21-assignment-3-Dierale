        <h1>My Arch Nemesis - THE ORANGE DANGLER</h1>
        <p>
            Little is known about my elusive arch foe other than his calling card.  
            You'll find the Orange Dangler himself hanging off any belltower he can find.
            He finds his dangling post during sunrise or sunset so that he can blend in with his orange camoflauge.
            Once he's in position he repeatedly rings the bells in these belltowers to irrate the townsfolk to no end.
            His unique coloration and perfect timing make him impossible to catch, and by the time the authorities arrive,
            he's already off on another belltower ringing away.  When the light finally comes or the dark descends he sets
            off into the night, lost in the wind until his next ringing spree.
