        <h1>My Arch Nemesis - THE ORANGE DANGLER</h1>
        <p>
            Little is known about my elusive arch foe other than his calling card.  
            You'll find the Orange Dangler himself hanging off any belltower he can find.
            He finds his dangling post during sunrise or sunset so that he can blend in with his orange camouflage.
            Once he's in position he repeatedly rings the bells in these belltowers to irrate the townsfolk to no end.
            His unique coloration and perfect timing make him impossible to catch, and by the time the authorities arrive,
            he's already off on another belltower ringing away.  When the light finally comes or the dark descends he sets
            off into the night, lost in the wind until his next ringing spree.  Some say you can find him hidden deep in light.
        </p>

        <h3>FINDING THE DANGLER</h3>
        <p>
            As stated the Dangler himself hides deep in the light of the sun to avoid capture.  But that secretly
            is also his bane.  If you follow the right directions you'll be able to find his hidden lair.
