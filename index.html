        <h3>My Favorite Place: The Mountains of New Mexico</h3>
        <p>
            The mountains of <bold>New Mexico</bold> are one of my favorite places in the world.
            If we want to be specific, the <bold>Sangre de Cristo Mountains</bold> of the Rocky Mountains is the most accurate description.
            I visited them with my father when I was younger and I treasure the memories I have of that.
