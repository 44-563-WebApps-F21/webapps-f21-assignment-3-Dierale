        <h1>I'm secretly known as AVERAGE MAN</h1>
        <p>
            Average Man is a super hero known for being able to do anything!<br>
            Except everything he does comes out painfully average.<br>
            Need your homework done? Done in in a jiffy! But it's a C.<br>
            There's a robbery? I'll be there, just after the cops are already done catching the guy.<br>
            Is your cat stuck in an obstacle course of weird trees? I'll get there but it'll take me a while.<br>
            I always finish the race! I just don't finish first.

        <h3>Things to Try</h3>
        <p>
            As a super hero I'm not just about helping people, but I also promote diversity in their lives!<br>
            I think everyone should try new things, and while we're on the topic I'd like to recommend some cool things!<br>
            Down below I'm listing 4 foods and drinks I think will change up your taste buds!

        <h3>Graphing Algorithms</h3>
        <p>
            Now you see, super heroes aren't just about saving people and diversity either!<br>
            What kind of super hero would I be if I didnt want to help educate people too!<br>
            I've had a recent interest in graphing algorithms and I wanted to show you my favorite.<br>
            What we have here below is known as the Dijkstra Algorithm<br>
            Here's what Wikipedia has to say about it:
        </p>

        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">
            <p>
                Dijkstra's algorithm (/ˈdaɪkstrəz/ DYKE-strəz) is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, 
                which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 
                and published three years later.
                The algorithm exists in many variants. Dijkstra's original algorithm found the shortest path between two given nodes,
                but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all
                 other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.
