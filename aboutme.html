        <h1>I'm secretly known as AVERAGE MAN</h1>
        <p>
            Average Man is a super hero known for being able to do anything!<br>
            Except everything he does comes out painfully average.<br>
            Need your homework done? Done in in a jiffy! But it's a C.<br>
            There's a robbery? I'll be there, just after the cops are already done catching the guy.<br>
            Is your cat stuck in an obstacle course of weird trees? I'll get there but it'll take me a while.<br>
            I always finish the race! I just don't finish first.

        <h3>Things to Try</h3>
        <p>
            As a super hero I'm not just about helping people, but I also promote diversity in their lives!<br>
            I think everyone should try new things, and while we're on the topic I'd like to recommend some cool things!<br>
            Down below I'm listing 4 foods and drinks I think will change up your taste buds!
