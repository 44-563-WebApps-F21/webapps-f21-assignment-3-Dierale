        <h1>I'm secretly known as AVERAGE MAN</h1>
        <p>
            Average Man is a super hero known for being able to do anything!<br>
            Except everything he does comes out painfully average.<br>
            Need your homework done? Done in in a jiffy! But it's a C.<br>
            There's a robbery? I'll be there, just after the cops are already done catching the guy.<br>
            Is your cat stuck in an obstacle course of weird trees? I'll get there but it'll take me a while.<br>
            I always finish the race! I just don't finish first.
